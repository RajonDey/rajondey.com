I belong to the Music through my most adorable guitar, which I often play with absolute passion. When my intelligence has turned against me, it helps me to calm down and focus on anything with crystal clarity.</p>

<p><span class="emoji">👨‍🎓</span> I studied Business Administration at Leading University and graduated in 2017. I completed a one-year Web Development training program at the Sylhet IT Academy.</p>
<p><span class="emoji">🧑‍💼</span> I learned to code and started making websites in 2015 and worked as a web developer freelancer on various marketplaces. I am currently employed as a Module Lead of Pixels Pod (frontend developer team) in SJ Innovation LLC since 2019.</p>
<p><span class="emoji">🎬</span> I create digital content over the internet - write articles and documents, create videos, and capture photos that explore the realms of the web, the rhythm of music, and the essence of life itself. In addition, I curate a biweekly newsletter where I share my deepest reflections and adventures with subscribers, taking them on a journey through my world.</p>

					<h2 class="section-title">Lifestyle & Hobbies</h2>
<p><span class="emoji">🎸</span> I found music is deeply connected with me somewhere, as it feels so fulfilling when I can make a small piece of music. I practice music through my most adorable guitar, which I often play with absolute passion. It makes me creative and energetic, and when my intelligence has turned against me, it helps me to calm down and focus on anything with crystal clarity.</p>
<p><span class="emoji">🧑‍💻</span> While my profession keeps me engaged, I've discovered that coding and immersing myself in cutting-edge technologies have become my second most cherished hobby. I dedicate a significant portion of my life to the world of the web, where I constantly explore and unravel its mysteries.</p>
<p><span class="emoji">🥤</span> I also like to do a lot of stuff like driving, traveling, reading, researching, investing, gardening, cooking, and so on, which I usually do when my time allows me to do so. In my free time, I also like to take on the role of a photographer and videographer, finding joy in capturing moments. I engage in sports like badminton, cricket, and chess, and I maintain a healthy balance with exercise, meditation, and yoga.</p>
